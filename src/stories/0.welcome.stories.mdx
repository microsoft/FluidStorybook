# Welcome to the Fluid Framework Playground

The Fluid Framework is a real-time collaboration technology that can be used to sync state between multiple users.
The playground provides a way to interact with Fluid objects running side by side in the browser, see what's possible,
and even explore the source code for the demos. 

When viewing a demo you can perform the following actions:

* View a demo on its own by clicking the **Canvas tab**.
* Get details about a demo by clicking the **Docs tab**. 
* View the source code for a demo by clicking the **Source tab**. If you want to view additional files you can select one from the drop-down 
and even drill down into the code by clicking on supported `import` statements.

**To get started** select a demo from the left sidebar!

Note: Additional demos for other libraries/frameworks will be coming in the future.
