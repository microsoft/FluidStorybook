# Sticky Storm

This example demonstrates how to build a custom idea sharing board. Users can create a "sticky note" with an idea
on it and then add it to the board. Connected users will automatically see the new sticky note and are able
to create and share sticky notes of their own. As notes are added, all connected users can
vote on the proposed sticky note ideas and can highlight their own ideas.
