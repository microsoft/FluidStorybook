# Welcome to the Fluid Playground

Fluid is a real-time collaboration framework that can be used to sync state between multiple users.

To get started select a demo from the left sidebar.

As you view a demo you can also get details about it by clicking the `Docs` tab. Interested in viewing the source code for a demo?
